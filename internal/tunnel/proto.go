// The tunnel protocol has a version of its own, apart from the programs'
// versions, so that one pf-client works with servers of several ages and
// the other way round. Each side speaks a range of versions; they use the
// highest both have.
//
// Protocol 1 is SEALED. It is what pf-simple 0.14.0 speaks:
//
//   - serve: a word, a name and a target; a serve token, or none where the
//     server allows serving without one; optionally the SHA-256 of a
//     client token that whoever connects must give.
//   - connect and check: a word; the client token if the tunnel has one.
//   - accept: a word and a connection id, or the reason there is no
//     connection.
//   - version: a serve token; the answer is the server's program version
//     and the protocol range it speaks, as JSON (ServerInfo). It is the
//     only way to learn a server's version, and needs a valid serve token.
//   - the headers above, the WebSocket framing of ws.go and the "eof" and
//     "err:" text frames of stream.go.
//
// Nothing in protocol 1 may change: no header renamed, dropped or given a
// new meaning, no new header a peer must understand, no change to the
// frames. Whatever is added or changed goes into protocol 2, by the steps
// at the end of this comment, so that a side which only speaks 1 is told
// plainly instead of misunderstanding.
//
// Protocol 0 is the name for a side that does not announce a version:
// pf-simple and pf-client before 0.14.0. Such a side understands a word, a
// serve token, a name and a target, and may or may not do the rest of
// protocol 1 without saying so, so nothing beyond those is relied on with
// it. It is still spoken, for plain tunnels.
//
// The connecting or serving side sends the range it can use for this run
// in HeaderProto, as "min-max": min is raised to the version of the newest
// feature the run depends on, so a server that is too old for it says so
// instead of quietly ignoring the feature. The server answers every tunnel
// request, refused or not, with the version it chose in the same header,
// or with 426 and an explanation when the ranges do not meet. A server
// that sends no HeaderProto speaks protocol 0, and it is then for the
// client to refuse. The client sends its program's version in
// HeaderVersion, for the server's log and console only: nothing may be
// decided from it. The server does not send its own: it is not for
// whoever happens to reach the port, and is asked for with a serve token.
//
// To add protocol N+1: raise ProtoMax; describe it here as protocol 1 is
// described; add it to protoRelease; give each new feature an entry in
// featureProto and have Client.needs name it; make the server honor it
// only when the chosen version allows. Raise ProtoMin only to stop
// speaking to old peers, which is a decision for the project's owner.
